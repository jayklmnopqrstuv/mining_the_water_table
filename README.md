## Challenge Description

This is a challenge hosted by *DrivenData*

Link to the challenge: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

## Goal of this implementation

Compare the performance of an implemented neural network to identify the pumps that are  functional, not functional and needs repair.

## Results of the model

Classification rate: 79.91%

This model has been in the top 20% of all the submission when this was submitted. 
Model with the highest accuracy: 82.94%

## About the codes in the repository

Exploration and creation of the model is saved in a Jupyter notebook: `model_nn.ipynb`

Test and training data are all saved in the `csv` format and should be stored in the same directory with the notebook

A presentation was also attached in the repository to summarize the processes and results.
